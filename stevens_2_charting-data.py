#MtG Historical Analysis Part 2: Charting Data
#MatPlotLib will be used to create charts of several historical trends of interest over the game's development. One will be a multi-line graph depicting the numbers of cards of each major type published in each successive card set, to show trends in the relative numbers of e.g. creature cards vs. sorcery cards over time. Another series of charts will sample several card sets of interest and depict their mana curves for different card types, i.e. the number of cards in the set broken down by card type and mana cost.
