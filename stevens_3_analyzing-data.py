#MtG Historical Analysis Part 3: Analyzing Data
#This analysis will dig into the frequency with which Magic the Gathering has published cards of different type and cost over time, starting with the same data as the charts described in Part 2 and following any interesting trends which emerge in more detail. Additionally, the data set will be analyzed to select a few mechanical keywords and perform an analysis of how frequently those keywords appear in cards of each set, e.g.: the 2021 "Midnight Hunt" set is known for its use of cards with keyword "disturb": in what set and year did this keyword first appear, and how frequently has it been used since? Finally, create an HTML table showing how many counterspells were published in each set and what years those sets occurred in.
